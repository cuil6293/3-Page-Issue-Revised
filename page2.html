	<p>One of the most obvious problems with the melting of the glaciers and ice caps is the increasing sea levels. However, this means a higher risk of flooding in coastal areas, causing more people to be displaced from their homes. The worst of those affected will be those with lower socioeconomic status</p>
	<p>Furthermore, melting glaciers make their own situation worse as they can release bacteria that will then consume frozen organic matter and <span class = "highlighter"> release carbon dioxide</span>. These same melting glaciers are also the ones that trap ancient reservoirs of methane.</p>

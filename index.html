			<p>It's cliche, but <span class = "highlighter">humans</span> are the main reason why our glaciers are melting. Global warming is caused by <span class="highlighter">greenhouse gases</span>, and in recent years our greenhouse gas emissions have only been increasing. Each individual has a <span class="highlighter">carbon footprint</span>, and whether they want to think about it or not, they contribute to global warming and climate change.</p>	

			<p>However, humans as individual aren't the biggest contributors to global warming. <span class="highlighter">Big industries</span> are the biggest culprits. In fact, all industries, including the fashion and food industries, use a great deal of <span class="highlighter">fossil fuels</span> and release a huge amount of pollutants into the atmosphere. The pollution caused by these companies, in comparison to individuals, accounts for most of the pollution around the world!</p>
